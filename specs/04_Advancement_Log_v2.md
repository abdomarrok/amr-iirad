## 🔧 Recent Achievements (Stabilization Phase)

### 📅 2026-05-10 (Night): Fat JAR Deployment & Debtor Metadata Expansion
- ✅ **Production Build Architecture**: Transitioned to a "Fat JAR" model using `maven-shade-plugin`. This bundles all dependencies (JavaFX, Jasper, MariaDB) into a single executable file, eliminating classpath issues on client machines.
- ✅ **Main Launcher Implementation**: Created a specialized `Main.java` entry point to bypass JavaFX module-path requirements for standalone execution.
- ✅ **Ikonli SPI Merging**: Configured `ServicesResourceTransformer` in the build process to resolve runtime icon loading failures in the executable JAR.
- ✅ **Debtor Metadata Expansion (NIS)**: Added full support for the **NIS Number** (رقم التعريف الإحصائي) across the stack:
    - Added `nisNumber` to `Debtor` model.
    - Implemented database migration for `nis_number` column.
    - Updated `DebtorRepository` and `DebtorFormController` UI.
    - Integrated NIS parameter into all 10 JasperReport templates via `ReportParamBuilder`.
- ✅ **Test Suite Stabilization**: Fixed compilation errors in `RevenueOrderServiceTest` caused by recent model refactoring, ensuring the CI/CD pipeline remains green.
- ✅ **Build Automation**: Hardened `pom.xml` with robust shade, dependency, and surefire plugin configurations, aligning with professional enterprise standards.

### 📅 2026-05-10 (Late Afternoon): FXML Modernization & Reporting Data Integrity
- ✅ **Architectural Decoupling (FXML-First)**: Successfully extracted all programmatic UI layouts from Java code into declarative FXML templates. This includes loading dialogs, language selection modals, timeline items, and permission grids.
- ✅ **Report Data Consistency**: Hardened `ReportParamBuilder` to eliminate "null" displays in official documents. Standardized parameter naming (`REASON_AR`, `LIQUIDATION_BASIS`, etc.) across all 10 Jasper templates.
- ✅ **Jasper Syntax Fix**: Resolved a critical `JacksonRuntimeException` in Annexe 5 templates by correcting invalid padding attributes for compatibility with JasperReports 7.
- ✅ **Institutional Metadata Hardening**: Fixed incorrect Ordonnateur code mapping in Dispatch Slip reports and ensured Treasury names are correctly localized in both Arabic and French.
- ✅ **UI Component Standardization**: Created specialized FXML components for recurring UI elements (e.g., `fiscal-year-dialog.fxml`, `permission-category-group.fxml`), improving codebase maintainability.

### 📅 2026-05-10: Reporting Infrastructure Hardening & Official Legal Alignment
- ✅ **Standardized Institutional Data**: Added `treasury_name_ar` to the data model, repository, and UI, ensuring full bilingual mapping of institutional metadata (Treasury, Ministry, Institution).
- ✅ **Unified Report Parameters**: Implemented a standardized parameter dictionary in `ReportParamBuilder` (`MINISTRY_NAME`, `INSTITUTION_NAME`, `TREASURY_NAME`, `BUDGET_CODE`, etc.), eliminating template-specific mapping inconsistencies.
- ✅ **Legal Narrative Alignment**: Refactored narrative text in Annexes 1, 2, and 3 (AR/FR) to strictly match the official legal phrasing of Algerian Instruction 08.
- ✅ **Automated Parameter Injection**: Hardened `ReportParamBuilder` to automatically fetch and inject institutional info from `AppContext`, preventing "missing field" errors in generated reports.
- ✅ **Bilingual Jasper Templates**: Standardized and verified 10 core Jasper templates (Annexes 1-5, AR/FR) for consistent parameter usage and layout fidelity.
- ✅ **UI Precision**: Updated Enterprise settings to allow separate Arabic and French titles for treasury metadata, ensuring administrative accuracy in official documents.

### 📅 2026-05-10: Fiscal Year Scoping & Premium UI Refinement
- ✅ **Fiscal-Year-Scoped Budgeting**: Refactored the entire budget hierarchy to be specific to the active fiscal year. Budget chapters are now isolated by year, preventing data pollution across financial cycles.
- ✅ **Database Migration**: Implemented idempotent migration for `budget_chapter` table, adding `fiscal_year_id` and a `UNIQUE KEY uq_code_year (code, fiscal_year_id)`.
- ✅ **Repository Hardening**: Updated `BudgetChapterRepository` to strictly enforce year-based filtering for all query and update operations.
- ✅ **Design System Modularization**: Refactored CSS architecture by creating `buttons.css` and expanding `theme.css` design tokens. Moved over 60 lines of styles into modular components.
- ✅ **Premium UI/UX Polish**: Upgraded "Cancel" and "Reduce" action buttons with linear gradients, depth shadows, and interactive hover effects, while maintaining geometric consistency (8px radius).
- ✅ **Timeline Rendering Fix**: Resolved "broken icons" issue in the status timeline by adopting the dashboard's CSS pattern (`styleClass` based rendering) and Constructor-based `FontIcon` initialization in Java.
- ✅ **Global Theme Cleanup**: Successfully eliminated all inline hex codes and RGBA values from CSS and Controller files, routing all styling through centralized design tokens.

### 📅 2026-05-10 (Morning): Database Lifecycle & Server Configuration Hardening
- ✅ **Graceful Shutdown**: Implemented a JVM shutdown hook in `AmrIiradApp` to ensure the MariaDB connection pool is properly closed on application exit.
- ✅ **Advanced Server Configuration**: Updated `AppSettings` and `ServerConfigController` to support custom Database Names and Password persistence for remote connections.
- ✅ **Background Connection Testing**: Refactored the database initialization and connection test logic to run on background threads, ensuring a smooth, non-freezing UI during setup.
- ✅ **UX Labeling Overhaul**: Replaced cryptic regulatory labels (e.g., "Annexe 1") with clear, descriptive Arabic titles (e.g., "أمر الإيراد (المحاسب)") across all printing actions.
- ✅ **Premium UI Refinement**: Modernized the `ModeSelection` and `ServerConfig` views with GstockDz-inspired aesthetics, larger iconography, and responsive layouts.
- ✅ **Code Quality**: Hardened `DatabaseConnection` with synchronized shutdown logic and fixed `FontIcon` literal initialization in `OrderDetailsController`.

### 📅 2026-05-07 (Late Night): Reporting Unification & Design System Polish
- ✅ **Annexes 1-4 Printing**: Fully restored and enhanced order-specific reporting in `OrderDetailsController`. Support added for Annex 1 (Admin Order), Annex 2 (Debtor), Annex 3 (Cancellation), and Annex 4 (Reduction).
- ✅ **Cancellation & Reduction Workflows**: Integrated `CancellationOrderService` into the Order Details view, enabling secure, RBAC-guarded order lifecycle management.
- ✅ **GstockDz Design Import**: Successfully imported and adapted the premium table styling from GstockDz. Created `tableview.css` with improved spacing, zebra-padding, and hover effects.
- ✅ **CSS Orchestration Refactor**: Unified the styling system by routing all styles through `app.css` → `master.css` → `tableview.css` / `theme.css`.
- ✅ **Global Typography**: Enforced the `Cairo` font-family application globally at the `.root` level for professional Arabic UI consistency.
- ✅ **Settings Navigation**: Fixed navigation dead-ends in Enterprise and Audit Log views by standardizing on `BorderPane` with integrated `TopBar` back-button support.

### 📅 2026-05-07 (Night): Security Hardening & Dispatch Module
- ✅ **Full RBAC Enforcement**: Integrated `AuthService` into all core controllers (`RevenueOrderList`, `RevenueOrderForm`, `DebtorList`, `Dashboard`).
- ✅ **Action-Level Permissions**: Secured critical actions (Create, Edit, Print) with `authService.canDo()` checks and user-friendly error dialogs.
- ✅ **Dispatch Slips Activation**: Enabled the "Bordereaux d'Envoi" feature, registered controllers in `AppContext`, and fixed FXML controller resolution issues.
- ✅ **Permission Matrix Expansion**: Added granular permissions (`dispatch.*`, `settings.manage`, `budget_chapter.manage`) to the database seed logic.

### 📅 2026-05-07 (Late Evening): Compilation & Runtime Stabilization
